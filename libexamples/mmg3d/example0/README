Example of basic use of library libmmg3d5:
  3 main steps: - STEP   I/ Build mesh and sol at MMG5 format
                - STEP  II/ Call MMG5 library
                - STEP III/ Get the final mesh and sol

  Results are saved in mesh.o.mesh and mesh.o.sol files

example0_a:
  We read mesh and solution files (cube.mesh and cube.sol) using the MMG5_loadMesh and MMG5_loadMet functions.
  Results are saved using MMG5_saveMesh and MMG5_saveMet functions.

example0_b:
  The mesh and solution are hard coded.
  They are build in MMG5 format using API functions and are recovered by the same way.
  We show how to recover the mesh/sol by writting it in mesh.o.mesh/sol file.
